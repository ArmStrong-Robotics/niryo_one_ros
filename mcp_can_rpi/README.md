RPI3 library for MCP2515 module (CAN bus interface) through SPI GPIOs

Forked from : https://github.com/coryjfowler/MCP_CAN_lib

The library has the same features, but is working on a Raspberry Pi 3.

One of the main difference is we don't handle SPI Chip Select PIN. This is already done by the wiringPi library, and
all PINS for SPI are already predefined (spi channel 0 or 1).

This library is licensed under GPLv3, for now.
